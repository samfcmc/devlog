Hi guys!
My name is Samuel and I am a portuguese guy.
This is the first post in my new project which is this blog.
I have a full time job as a `software developer` and I love technology since I was a little kid.
When I grew up I decided to go to college to learn Software Engineering.
In the last semester in college I became a teaching assistant in Software Engineering classes.
Yes, I was a teacher and a student at the same time!
It was really great!

Now I have a full time job and I miss those days when I was helping others achieving success.
I decided to start this blog to share what I know and hopefully `help you to become a kick ass developer`.
I am going to try to write about interesting stuff.
Maybe you already know about something I write about, but this blog is also intended to help beginners.
I am going to try to write small posts instead of big walls of text so you can read at least one post in a matter of minutes and learn something.

I hope you guys like it.
This is just the beginning.

All developers out there or developers wanna be...
Stay tunned :)
